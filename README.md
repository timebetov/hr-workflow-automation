# Task 1

* IoC (Inversion Of Control)
* DI (Dependency Injection)

Simple console application using Spring core. Here I used three DTO classes such as:
1. Candidate
2. Interview
3. Job
 
Designed One-To-Many relationship between Job and Candidate. One job can have multiple candidates.
Also implemented basic CRUD operations.
Got service bean from Spring ApplicationContext in `main` method.

Created objects using Builder pattern with help of Lombok.
